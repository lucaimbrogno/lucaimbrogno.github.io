# README

Repo for my personal site. You can check it out at lucaimbrogno.herokuapp.com

I built this site to sharpen my web development skills as well as to showcase some of the projects I am working on. This site is built on the Ruby on Rails framework. Currently split up into three sections:

Work Experience:
- Contains details on a few of the internships I've had over the past few years

Projects:
- A showcase of a few of my favourite software projects
- Some of the projects are built directly into the Rails app so you can play around with them on the site while others are just a demonstration and explanation of why I worked on the project and how I achieved it
- Also includes a display of some of my favourite features that I worked on during my internship at Socialpeeks

Web Design
- Includes some of the websites I've built for clients in the past

This site definitely helped me sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS. It also gave me a better understanding of the MVC frameowrk and how that can be used to build out certain systems.
